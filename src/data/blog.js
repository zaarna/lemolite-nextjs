      Ever wonder how smart assistants like Siri and Alexa work, or what the future of self-driving cars will look like? The answer is machine learning. With the areas of application ranging from healthcare, and finance to marketing and more — it is poised as a game-changing technology.<br/>
      Machine learning is a subfield in computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed and where algorithms can be improved by adding more data.<br/>
      But to make it work, we need a programming language — and Python becomes everyone's first choice because it's easy to learn and simple to use. Processing data and deriving insights are pivotal, and libraries like NumPy and Pandas make that effortless. They simplify complex algorithms into a few lines of code, making AI development much more accessible.<br/>
      Python introduces cool projects for everyone — whether you're a newbie or an expert. In this spirit, we’ve compiled a comprehensive guide to machine learning with Python.`,

      Python and ML fundamentals: Understand the what, when, where, and how of core concepts — data types, control structures, lists, dictionaries, loops, and functions.<br/>
      Discover Datasets: Search for datasets on any topic. Platforms like Kaggle offer a wide variety of datasets tailored for ML tasks.<br/>
      For Beginners: Start with Scikit-learn. Learn how to import datasets, preprocess data, and apply machine learning algorithms.<br/>
      Specialize in Deep Learning: Once you're confident with the basics, move into deep learning using TensorFlow or PyTorch. These frameworks help you turn neural network code into powerful training-ready models.<br/>
